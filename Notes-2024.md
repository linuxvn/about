### The odd thing!

I still speak human but I don't speak Vietnamese anymore. Lmao it's a joke.
The problem is that when I start this new blog I thought it'd be in English.

What is the odd thing today? That's the only thing we face everyday.
It's `k8s` in short, aka `kubernetes`.

I really meant my `k8s`. Because there are too many `k8s`s.
Your `k8s`, my `k8s`, his `k8s`, and who knows if your mother-in-law also has `k8s`.
Your Android device can also have something `k8s` with https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav.

Oh my `<insert-your-****-here>`, there is `Oracle`'s kubernetes =)
That comes with `coredns`, where number of pods equals to number of nodes
on your system. But it's never a `daemonset`. Seriously? No. Because when
it's configured with `255` addresses in the range but you can allocate up to
`255/2 ~ 127` because someone decides that the right way to do. This is even
more serious? No. Because if you want to change the boot volume, you don't know
the configuration goes, on cloud or 10m under your basement?
Look https://github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/terraform-oci-oke/issues/878,
is this serious? Even NO! Because the most serious thing is that when you
need new `k8s` cluster in your fancy `terraform` code, you create new `vpc`,
`subnet` ,... and you create database within them, and someday you decice
to replace the cluster with a new one, haha, you would have found your data
is faster than you: it's gone, it's gone haha =))

Then comes `operator`. It's very coool. Because `helm-chart` can be weird,
random, very `lauxanh`, very `thiendia` and both of them must live in
the same template folder, (for that reason) we would go with `operator`.
But new war game starts immediately, `operator` vs. `helm`.
I lost in this war, my sword is so sweet it damages other fighers
that when I lost them lolz

So I hate `k8s`. I cry on my shoulder. `k8s` is the odd thing
that `Google` invented and made my job terrible ^.^ ahah, another joke okay?

You know there is only thing that still remains. And it would never be `k8s`.
